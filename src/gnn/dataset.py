"""
PyG datasets for QEC decoding.

Provides a streaming PyG dataset for QEC decoding via on-the-fly Stim
sampling and fired-detector graph building.

All tensors are returned on CPU.  Move to device in the training loop
via ``batch = batch.to(device)`` — this keeps ``DataLoader(num_workers>0)``
safe (workers cannot share CUDA state).

    """Streaming PyG dataset with on-the-fly Stim sampling.

    Each DataLoader worker owns its own set of Stim
    ``CompiledDetectorSampler`` instances, seeded deterministically from
    ``master_seed`` and ``worker_id`` via BLAKE2b (``stable_seed``).

    Per shot, a setting is sampled uniformly from the configured list,
    giving uniform per-shot ``p`` selection.  The iterator is infinite —
    the training loop controls how many samples to consume.

    Returned ``Data`` fields
    ------------------------
    x : FloatTensor, shape ``(N, 6)``
        Node features: ``[x_norm, y_norm, t_norm, d_x, d_y, basis]``.
    edge_index : LongTensor, shape ``(2, E)``
        Directed COO edges (complete graph on fired detectors).
    edge_attr : FloatTensor, shape ``(E, 5)``
        Edge features: ``[dx, dy, dt, euclidean, chebyshev]``.
    y : FloatTensor, shape ``(num_observables,)``
        Ground-truth observable flip (training target).
    logical : FloatTensor, shape ``(num_observables,)``
        Same as ``y`` (present for eval compatibility).
    num_fired : LongTensor, scalar
        Number of fired detectors (0 for trivially correct shots).
    p : FloatTensor, scalar *(only when* ``include_p_feature=True`` *)*
        Physical error probability for this shot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings : sequence of CircuitSetting
        Circuit settings to sample from.
    master_seed : int
        Master seed for reproducibility.
    include_p_feature : bool
        If ``True``, attach ``p`` as a graph-level feature.
